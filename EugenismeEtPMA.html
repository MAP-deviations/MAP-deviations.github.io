				<article><span class="titrepartie"> Eugenics, a consequence of MAP ? </span>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
					The term of <span class="important">eugenics</span> means all the practices to <b>improve humanity</b> by selecting the individuals who have “good” <b>genes</b>. Francis Galton
					created this term in <i>1883</i>, but some years before that, <b>Charles Darwin</b> had already said :
					<br/><br/>
<i>“With savages, the weak in body or mind are soon eliminated; and those that survive commonly exhibit a vigorous state of health. We civilised men, on
 the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination; we build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed, and the sick; we institute poor-laws; 
 and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. There is reason to believe that vaccination has preserved 
 thousands, who from a weak constitution would formerly have succumbed to small-pox. Thus the weak members of civilised societies propagate their kind. No
 one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man.”</i>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Indeed, man selected individuals according to their genes, on <b>animals</b> like dogs or on plants for example. In nature, <span class="important">natural selection</span> keeps only <b>strong 
individuals</b>, so they can give their <span class="important">DNA</span> to their descendants. But when the <b>technological revolution</b> happened, the progress of hygiene and medicine allowed
 to reduce <b>death rate</b>: humans didn’t undergo natural selection anymore. In this way, lots of scientists worried about a potential <b>degeneration</b> of humanity.
 <br/>
 <br/>
There are <b>two kinds</b> of eugenics : <span class="important">“negative eugenics”</span>, which means <b>avoiding the birth</b> and the reproduction of individuals who have “lower” genes, and <span class="important">“positive
 eugenics”</span> which means <b>encouraging the reproduction</b> of “better” individuals.
 <br/>
 <br/>
The most famous example of eugenics policy is the <b>Nazi government</b>, who used two kinds of eugenics : on the one hand,  <b>Aryan</b> individuals, looked upon as 
“better” individuals, were encouraged to have a lot of children. On the other hand, “lower” individuals were put away, <b>sterilized</b> and often killed.
<br/>
However, some other states used eugenics : for example, in the seventies, <b>France</b> and <b>Sweden</b> sterilized lots of <b>mentally disabled</b>. Today, in the USA, there 
are still some <b>catalogs</b> to choose a sperm donor according to his appearance and his intelligence. But in France, sperm donation, in order to avoid that 
this practice becomes a market, is <b>anonymous</b>.
<br/><br/>

But today, the main tools of eugenics are <span class="important">abortion</span> and the <span class="important">selection of embryos</span>, which are the consequences of <b>Medically Assisted Procreation</b> (MAP): indeed,
 we have today lots of ways to <b>control the development</b> of embryos, and when a severe anomaly like <b>Down Syndrome</b> is detected, the parents can use a <span class="important">Medical
 Termination of Pregnancy</span>. This kind of abortion can also be used if the pregnancy or the birth represents a danger for the mother. This is the parents’ 
 decision, but it has to be approved by a council of doctors. Moreover, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy is closely <b>controlled</b> by the laws. In France,
 all pregnancies are watched by <b>three scans</b>, which can detect lots of anomalies.
 <br/>
 <br/>
Indeed, in France, those three scans are compulsary and completely repaid by the <i>French Social Security</i>. The <b>first scan</b> is made during the third month of 
pregnancy, to <b>date</b> more precisely the beginning of the pregnancy, to know the <b>number of embryos</b> existing, to make a first detection of <b>genetic diseases</b> by 
measuring the <span class="important">nuchal translucency</span>, an area behind the embryo’s neck. A thick nuchal translucency can be the evidence of  Down Syndrome, dwarfism or cardiac
 diseases. However, this is an <b>unreliable clue</b>, and some embryos which have anomalous nuchal translucency become healthful children. 
 <br/><br/>
The <b>second scan </b>is made during the fifth month, it is used to <b>follow up the growth</b> of the embryo and to check some prospective <b>anomalies</b> of organs and members.
The <b>third and last scan</b> is also used to follow up the growth of the embryo, its weight, its size, its position, the <b>amniotic fluid</b>…
<br/><br/>
If, during this scans, some anomalies are detected by the doctors, the parents can make other tests to confirm or not the risk of <b>genetic disease</b> for their
 future child. Let’s take the example of the Down Syndrome:
 <br/><br/>
 <span class="titrepartie"> How to diagnose a Down Syndrome ? </span>
 <br/><br/><br/>
The <span class="important">trisomy</span> is a genetic disease caused by the presence of <b>three chromosomes</b> instead of two in the embryo’s DNA. There are many kinds of trisomy, but the
 best known is trisomy twenty-one, also named as <span class="important">Down syndrome</span>, which affects the twenty-first pair of chromosomes. Indeed, trisomy twenty-one is one of the
 uncommon trisomies which don’t always drive death <b>in utero</b> of the embryo, however it causes lots of disorders like <b>cardiac diseases</b> and a <b>mental retardation</b>.
 <br/>
 <br/>
Here is the karyotype of an individual affected by<b> Down syndrome</b> <i>(from chu-st-etienne.fr)</i> :
<br/><br/>
<center><img src="EugenismeEtPMA.jpg"/></center><br/><br/>
The only way to diagnose a trisomy without any doubt is to make an <span class="important">amniocentesis</span>, which is a puncture of amniotic fluid. Analyzing this fluid will allow us
 to know the embryo’s <b>karyotype</b>. However, this process can be <b>dangerous</b> for the embryo, that’s why the doctors choose to practice it only when they have 
 serious doubts about the good health of the embryo.
 <br/><br/>
 
The first clue is, as we have seen it before, the thickness of the <b>nuchal translucency</b>, but it isn’t reliable enough. However, during the second scan, some 
anomalies like a thick neck, a large gap between the first and the second toe or some cardiac diseases can confirm the risk of a trisomy. These observations
 can be completed by a <span class="important">Human chorionic gonadotropin</span> (HCG) control, which is a <b>hormone</b> in the mother’s blood during the pregnancy; if its rate changes anormally, it can be 
 the sign of a problem. 
 
 <br/><br/>
The <b>reckoning of the probability </b>of trisomy relies on all these observations, but also on other factors like if the mother smokes, her age or the antecedents 
in the family. The <b>amniocentesis</b> to confirm the risk is made from a probability of <b>1/250 chance</b> in France, and <b>1/300</b> in Great Britain. 
<br/><br/>
<br/>
 Another consequence of the Medically Assisted Procreation is the <span class="important">selection of embryos</span>: during an in vitro fertilization, several embryos are cultured on a
 laboratory, and those which have a risk of genetic diseases will never be <b>implanted</b> in the mother’s uterus : this is named the <span class="important">preimplantation genetic 
 diagnosis</span>. In this way, only the “best” embryos are <b>selected</b>, and this eventually drives to an <b>improvement of the human genes</b>. 
 
 <br/><br/>
But these decisions are <b>subjective</b>: how to choose objectively if a life is worth  being lived, in spite of a major <b>handicap</b> ? Moreover, some people are 
afraid of a deviation of this practice: by beginning to manipulate the human’s genes, how could we resist the temptation of creating a <b>“perfect” child</b>, 
exactly as we ‘d like to ?
